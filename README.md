# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. [Try it](https://PattemChaitanya.github.io/sort-visualizer)

## Algorithms used

Selection Sort - It is algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (Ascending order) from unsorted part and putting at the beginning.

Bubble Sort - This algorithm swaps two adjacent elements if they are in wrong positions.

Insertion Sort - It is an algorithm sorts an array in a way that it picks an element and compare with its predecessors and place it in a sort array.

Merge Sort - This Algorithm approaches divide and conquer startegy. It divides an array it two eqaul parts and they are combined in a sorted manner.

Quick Sort - This algorithm is also uses divide and conquer startegy. It picks an pivot element and partitions the array and then it sort the elements accordingly.
